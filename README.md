# New Patient Medication Classification
This project uses data collected about a set of patients whom all have suffered from the same illness. Throughout their treatment, each patient responded to one of five different drugs: drugA, drugB, drugC, drugX, and drugY. This data is then used to build and train a model that helps find a proper drug which would be appropriate for a new patient based on different features including age, sex, blood pressure, and more. The model is a decision tree that uses a 70:30 split with 140 features to train, 60 to test, and a max depth of four. The data can be found [here](https://github.com/tabburn/medication-classification/blob/main/resources/drug200.csv).

## Summary
The purpose of this project is to predict appropriate medication for future patients based on historical data of past patients' response to the different medications. First we'll clean the data and get it prepared for machine learning and then make a predictive model using a decision tree. At the end of the analysis we'll take a look at how accurate our model is. This data analysis answers questions like:

* What is the best medication for a future patient?
* What levels of entropy are present throughout the model?
* How well does our decision tree model perform?
